# Proposal For a cjdns Research Project

[cjdns](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns/blob/master/doc/Whitepaper.md) is an encrypted IPv6 network that uses a DHT for routing.

## Why Learn About cjdns in a Networking Class?

cjdns addresses many of the security and scalability issues that currently plague traditional networks. By researching cjdns a student not only learns about possible solutions to these problems, but is also forced to understand the problems themselves. The only way to understand the problems themselves is to understand the original protocols that caused them. In short, a thourough knowledge of networking concepts results from this research.

## What Particular Topics Will Be Addressed?

As with most technologies, cjdns stands on the shoulders of giants. Some of the things that need to be understood to fully understand it are:

* Distributed Hash Tables
* Public and Private Key Cryptography
* Overlay Networks
* IPv6 addressing
* Cjdns Route Labels 

## Why is it Important?

* Currently [hyperboria](https://hyperboria.net/), quite possibly the largest, active mesh network, utilizes cjdns as a layer 3 protocol. It has gained widespread popularity, undergone significant revisions over its lifetime and [continues to be developed](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns).
* Even after the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses, IPv6 has yet to gain significant support. It is likely that newer networks will STILL be built on top of older networks.
* cjdns is an open-source project, meaning it is much easier to analzye and that its contributions are shared with the whole world.
